MasterCook is an organization founded by YoungChefs, a group of young successful cooks in Vietnam. they always think of how to serve best meals for customers, as a result, they are insearch of new favorite recipes.
In early days, they started to found a club of cooking lover. As it turns out, cooks had a huge appetite for sharing recipes; the club was an instant success. Over a few years later, YoungChefs wanted to expand the club and social network allowing cooks of all types and interests to connect through recipes, cooking tips, personal collections, and more. What started with a single cookie recipe has grown organically to become the large food-focused social network with a community of over 50 home cooks consuming more than 1000 recipes.
“Everyone can cook”, that is the slogan of YoungChefs. They want to share all the recipes of meals for passionate people and make an online magazine about food. This is the idea of MasterCook.
